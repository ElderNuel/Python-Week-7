# Data Analysis with Pandas and Matplotlib

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates data analysis and visualization techniques using Python's Pandas library for data manipulation and Matplotlib/Seaborn for creating insightful visualizations. The analysis is performed on the classic Iris dataset, which contains measurements of various iris flower species.

## Features
- **Data Loading & Exploration**: Loads the Iris dataset and performs initial data inspection
- **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values and prepares data for analysis
- **Statistical Analysis**: Computes descriptive statistics and group-wise aggregations
- **Data Visualization**: Creates four distinct types of plots:
  - Line chart showing measurement trends
  - Bar chart comparing averages across species
  - Histogram displaying feature distribution
  - Scatter plot revealing correlations between features

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- numpy

## Installation
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn numpy
```

## Usage
1. Run the Python script in a Jupyter notebook or any Python environment
2. The code will:
   - Load and explore the Iris dataset
   - Perform statistical analysis
   - Generate visualizations
   - Display key insights from the data

## Results
The analysis reveals:
- Setosa species has the smallest petals but wider sepals
- Virginica has the largest sepals and petals
- Strong positive correlation between sepal and petal length
- Clear separation between species in the scatter plot

## File Structure
```

├── iris_analysis.py          # Main analysis script
├── iris_analysis.csv         # Output data file (generated)
└── README.md                 # Project documentation
```

## Sample Visualizations
The script generates a 2x2 grid of plots showing:
1. Measurement trends across samples
2. Average measurements by species
3. Distribution of sepal lengths
4. Correlation between sepal and petal lengths

## Customization
To use with your own dataset:
1. Replace the data loading section with your CSV file path
2. Adjust column names and analysis parameters as needed
3. Modify visualization settings to match your data characteristics
